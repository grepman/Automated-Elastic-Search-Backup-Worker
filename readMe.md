# How I made a worker-shell-script to automate Elastic Search Dumping/BackingUp data  

In my course of work I used to deal with a lot of Elastic Search, the thing is in a Scaling System you need to be able to 
Backup your Data in the format which is most suitable + Faster to backUp and Blazing fast to Push Up/ Restore also!

What works better than having an Automated Worker ready for You! 

## Requirements
  - UNIX system
  - BASH
  - Elastic Search
  - Elastic Dump
  - Node JS

> You can refer to the above Code which i shared
> So to run this just write this command
> Give the file backup.sh Execution permission and run
> You can 

> $ npm install elasticdump

> $ chmod 7777 ./backup.sh

> $ ./backup.sh
